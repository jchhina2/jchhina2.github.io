  <p>I am a student at <a href="https://www.utdallas.edu" target="_blank">The University of Texas at Dallas</a>. I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology with a minor in Computer Science. 
    I have experience in many programming languages, including Java, Python, Ruby, HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. 
    I hope to have a career in Business Analytics, Data Analytics or Front-end Web Development. I also have language skills as well, including Spanish and French proficiency. 
    
    <br>Initially, I have started my career path as a shift manager for <a href="https://www.chevron.com" target="_blank">Chevron</a>. I have picked up excellent speaking skills and behavioral skills. 
    I also have picked up great problem solving skills, and solved countless problems with my knowledge and judgement, satisfying many patrons. 
    I have then progressed as an intern for a small company where I analyzed reports through Microsoft Excel and other software and reported sales figures to higher management. 
    I have utilized marketing strategies by promoting future opportunities with long term corporate customers.
    
   <br>I currently reside in the Dallas-Fort Worth area and I am proud to call the area my home. I admire the many shops and restaurants in the area. 
   I also enjoy the high sense of safety in the area, and the residents are warm and friendly as well.
  
  <br>In my spare time, I like to exercise and learn. I also like to travel to different places, and have gotten into photography recently.
