  <p>I am a student at the University of Texas at Dallas. I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology with a minor in Computer Science. 
    I have experience in many programming languages, including Java, Python, Ruby, HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. 
    I hope to have a career in Business Analytics or Web Development. I also have language skills as well, including Spanish and French proficiency. 
    
    <br>Initially, I have started my career path as a shift manager for a convenience store. I have picked up excellent speaking skills and behavioral skills. 
    I also have picked up great problem solving skills, and solved countless problems with my knowledge and judgement, satisfying hundreds of patrons. 
    I have then progressed as an intern for a small company where I analyzed reports through Microsoft Excel and Quickbooks and reported sales figures to higher management. 
    I have utilized marketing strategies by promoting future opportunities with permanent customers.
